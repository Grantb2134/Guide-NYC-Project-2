First and foremost my partner and I would like to thank you for your time and consideration, as you allow us to take you on a journey through America's only city worth talking about. Enjoy!

The journey begins with an introduction and a list of the five boroughs that make New York City. Once you've selected the borough of your desire, you're then taken to a list of activites of that particular borough. From there you'll make a decsion, but there's no harm in looking at them all, you wont regret it. Then you open the door and the first thing you see is a wonderfull image representing that venue you've choosen along with a brief description. Its only brief so you can then add and make it your own. If you have time live a little return home utilizing the *Return Home* link and see all that the five boroughs have to offer. After all it doesnt get any better than NYC!
